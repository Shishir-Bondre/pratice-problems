# Intermediate Level

## Introduction

 - This are the intermediate level problems which junior/senior level programmer can use for pratice. Here should be through with any one of programming language.  
 - The intention behind this list is used get used to programming principles, design patterns, software approaches and make the most of it. 
 - This can be either a comand line interactive programs (or) libary.
 - More focus should on how you **scale the problem seamlessly** (make changes to the code without causing any ripple effects), focus is on readibality and extensibilty of the code.
 - Out of scope 1) optimization of program (add here....)
